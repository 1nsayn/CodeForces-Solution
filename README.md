## Introduction
Codeforces' aim is to offer you a convenient platform to organize, run and discuss programming contests. It will be a bit of a social network website, more than a news portal and more than an online judge. Being absolutely independent from me, you will be able to organize and run a contest. You will decide on your own if to make it open to the whole world or if it will be a contest for your University only. And if you're not interested in this, you might discuss the news in the contest world - read/write blogs, discuss topics, and support your dearest and nearest.
This Repo aims to have the solutions to all the problems on CodeForces and serve as a reference to everyone new to the platform.
